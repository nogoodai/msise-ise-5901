You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a Terraform configuration file for a {{TYPE_OF_REFARCH}} on AWS. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, production-ready Terraform configuration that encompasses all necessary resources for a scalable and secure {{TYPE_OF_REFARCH}} .

Here are the configuration details for the serverless web application architecture:
<configuration_details>
{{CONFIGURATION_DETAILS}}
</configuration_details>

Your Terraform configuration should include, but is not limited to, the following components:
<required_components>
{{REQUIRED_COMPONENTS}}
</required_components>

Follow these instructions to create the Terraform configuration:

1. Start the file with the required Terraform and provider blocks.
2. Organize the resources logically, grouping related resources together (e.g., networking, compute, storage, etc.).
3. Use variables for values that might change or need to be customized.
4. Implement proper naming conventions and tags for all resources.
5. Configure appropriate security groups and IAM roles with least privilege principles.
6. Set up CloudWatch logs and alarms for monitoring and alerting.
7. Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit where applicable.
8. Use Terraform data sources when referencing existing resources.
9. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms where necessary.
10. Add outputs for important resource information (e.g., API Gateway URL, Lambda function ARNs).

Ensure that your configuration follows AWS best practices for {{TYPE_OF_REFARCH}}  and considers scalability, security, and cost-efficiency.

Your output should be the complete contents of a single .tf file. Do not include any additional explanations or comments outside of the Terraform code. Use HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) syntax and include appropriate in-line comments to explain complex configurations or design decisions.

Begin your response with the opening tag <terraform_configuration> and end it with the closing tag </terraform_configuration>. The entire Terraform code should be contained within these tags.
