         - Node types: E.g., cache.t2.micro.
         - Number of nodes.
      Subnet Group:
         - Specify private subnets.
      Security:
         - Allow connections from WordPress instances.

6. Public ALB Configuration
   Purpose:
      Distribute traffic across WordPress instances.
   Key Components:
      Load Balancer:
         - Type: Application.
         - Listeners: HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
         - Security groups: Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS.
      Target Groups:
         - Protocol: HTTP.
         - Health check settings: Path, intervals, and thresholds.

7. RDS Configuration
   Purpose:
      Managed relational database for WordPress.
   Key Components:
      Database Instance:
         - Engine: MySQL or Aurora.
         - Instance class: db.t2.small or as required.
         - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
      Security Group:
         - Allow connections from WordPress application security group.
      Parameter Groups:
         - Adjust DB configurations (e.g., character set, timeouts).

8. CloudFront Configuration
   Purpose:
      Content delivery and caching for performance.
   Key Components:
      Distribution:
         - Origin: S3 bucket or ALB.

You are an experienced AWS DevOps engineer tasked with generating Terraform code to build out a WordPress architecture. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, production-ready Terraform configuration that encompasses all necessary resources for a scalable and secure WordPress deployment on AWS.

Your task is to generate a single Terraform file based on these details. The configuration should include all necessary resources and follow AWS best practices for a WordPress deployment.

Your Terraform configuration should include, but is not limited to, the following components:

- Provider configuration for AWS
- VPC and networking resources (subnets, route tables, internet gateway)
- Security groups for EC2 instances, RDS, and ELB
- EC2 instances for WordPress
- RDS instance for the WordPress database
- Elastic Load Balancer
- Auto Scaling Group for EC2 instances
- CloudFront distribution for content delivery
- S3 bucket for static assets
- Route 53 DNS configuration

Your output should only be the .tf file contents. Do not provide any addtional detail. 

Please proceed with your architecture design and Terraform code generation.
